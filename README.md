 This is my third challenge on the Frontend Mentor website. It has been a very rewarding and important learning experience for my Frontend Developer training project.

For this project, I had access to the drawing files in the Figma version, which made my work a lot easier.

I look forward to receiving comments that may contribute to this challenge in particular and to my learning in general.
